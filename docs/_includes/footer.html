      <h4>The Project</h4>
      <iframe src="https://ghbtns.com/github-btn.html?user=matthewehiggins&repo=NHS-Bootstrap&type=star&size=small" frameborder="0" scrolling="0" width="160px" height="30px"></iframe>
      <p>The downloadable releases are designed to be dropped in in place of Twitter Bootstrap, so there are no extra files and no complexities over which files to replace. That doesn't mean we want to replace Bootstrap! When we generate a copy of the files, we use the most recent release of Bootstrap, and some files are not modified at all.</p>

      <h4>The Creator</h4>

      <p>The project was created by Matthew Higgins, who noticed while creating another project (soon to be open source) that a big part of his time had been spent creating a Bootstrap theme, which could be useful in lots of projects, and decided to spin this out.</p>
