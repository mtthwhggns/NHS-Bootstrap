## NHS Bootstrap Theme

This project is a very early work in progress aimed at creating Bootstrap theme based on the NHS Corporate Identity guidelines, to make prototyping a solution for an NHS web app or similar quick, easy and painless for non-designers.

The idea is to work through the Bootstrap CSS and Components and tweak the CSS to ensure they look good in the colour scheme, while leaving the Bootstrap code unchanged to allow for quick, simple, drag-and-drop upgrades.

The Bootstrap repo is included as a submodule, and changes can be pulled upstream quickly, but the code does not need to be changed.
