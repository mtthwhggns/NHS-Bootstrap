## NHS Bootstrap Theme

This project is a very early work in progress aimed at creating Bootstrap theme based on the NHS Corporate Identity guidelines, to make prototyping a solution for an NHS web app or similar quick, easy and painless for non-designers.

You can see a live demo at [https://mtthwhggns.github.io/NHS-Bootstrap]

The idea is to work through the Bootstrap CSS and Components and tweak the CSS to ensure they look good in the colour scheme, while leaving the Bootstrap code unchanged to allow for quick, simple, drag-and-drop upgrades.

To use it in a project, just download the latest release, drop the CSS, JS and Fonts files into your project, replacing any existing Bootstrap, and you're ready to go! When a new version comes out, just drop the new files over the top of the old ones, and you're done!

As you don't need to include Bootstrap yourself (there was no point letting Bootstrap define lots of style information, just to include another file which overwrites it), you only have one dependency! Simple!
